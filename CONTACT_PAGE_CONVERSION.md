# Contact Page Conversion Summary

## ✅ Successfully Converted Contact Page to Next.js

The contact page from `html-project/infine/contact.html` has been successfully converted to Next.js at `/contact` route.

### 📁 **File Structure**

```
app/
├── contact/
│   └── page.tsx          # Contact page (converted from contact.html)
└── page.tsx              # Home page
```

### 🎯 **What Was Converted**

#### **Contact Page Sections:**
1. ✅ **Page Header** - With parallax background and breadcrumb navigation
2. ✅ **Contact Form** - With validation (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Message)
3. ✅ **Contact Information Cards**:
   - Call Us (with phone icon)
   - Email Us (with mail icon)
   - Visit Us (with location icon)
4. ✅ **Google Maps Integration** - Embedded map with proper iframe attributes
5. ✅ **FAQ Section** - Accordion with 5 questions
6. ✅ **Footer** - Full footer with contact info and social links

### 🎨 **Design Preservation**

All design elements remain **100% identical** to the HTML version:
- ✅ Same color scheme (Primary: #042A2D, Accent: #73ED7C)
- ✅ Same fonts (Fustat font family)
- ✅ Same spacing and layouts
- ✅ Same animations (WOW.js fadeIn effects with delays)
- ✅ Same form styling and validation
- ✅ Same background parallax effects
- ✅ Same hover effects on buttons and links

### 🔗 **Navigation Updates**

Updated all navigation links to use Next.js routing:
- `contact.html` → `/contact`
- `index.html` → `/`
- `about.html` → `/about`
- `service.html` → `/service`
- etc.

Both home page and contact page now have consistent navigation.

### 🖼️ **Assets Added**

Created contact page specific icons:
- `/public/images/icon-phone.svg` - Phone icon (green circle with phone symbol)
- `/public/images/icon-mail.svg` - Email icon (green circle with mail symbol)
- `/public/images/icon-location.svg` - Location icon (green circle with location pin)

### ⚙️ **Technical Implementation**

**Client-Side Rendering:**
```tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function ContactPage() {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);

  if (!mounted) {
    return null;
  }

  return (/* page content */);
}
```

This approach:
- ✅ Prevents hydration errors from jQuery DOM manipulation
- ✅ Ensures all animations and JavaScript work correctly
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with all jQuery plugins

### 📋 **Features Working**

All interactive features are functional:
- ✅ Contact form with validation
- ✅ Smooth scroll navigation
- ✅ WOW.js animations on scroll
