2. **Emily Carter** - Project Coordinator
3. **Olivia Martinez** - Software Engineer

5. **Amanda Taylor** - Financial Analyst
6. **David Wilson** - Operations Manager

### 🎬 **Animations Working**

All WOW.js animations are functional:
- Team member cards: fadeInUp with staggered delays
  - Member 1: 0s
  - Member 2: 0.2s
  - Member 3: 0.4s
  - Member 4: 0.6s
  - Member 5: 0.8s
  - Member 6: 1.0s
- Image hover effects with scale/zoom animation
- Social icons slide up on card hover

### 🔗 **Navigation Updates**

Updated all navigation links to use Next.js routing:
- `team.html` → `/team`
- `team-single.html` → `/team-single`
- `contact.html` → `/contact`
- `service.html` → `/service`
- `index.html` → `/`
- All other pages configured for future expansion

### ⚙️ **Technical Implementation**

**Client-Side Rendering:**
```tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function TeamPage() {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);

  if (!mounted) {
    return null;
  }

  return (/* page content */);
}
```

This approach:
- ✅ Prevents hydration errors from jQuery DOM manipulation
- ✅ Ensures all animations and JavaScript work correctly
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with all jQuery plugins

### 📋 **Features Working**

- ✅ Team member grid layout with responsive columns
